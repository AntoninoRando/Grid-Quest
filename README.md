# Grid Quest
A simple console game in which your goal is to complete a quest by reducing a grid of numbers!

The game is meant to be played in spare times, when you are at your computer and whant something fast and relaxing. It does not require expensive setup, neither does it requires much computer's power, so it is perfect to run and play instantly.

## Gameplay

When you play a new game, you embark on a new adventure full of quests. Each **quest** is simply a **number**: you have to obtain that number through mathematical operations. You can perform these operations between the number of a grid. Each operation performed takes 2 numbers and produce a new one, thus reducing the grid until one number remains: it must be the same as your quest!

Every quest fulfilled put you a step forward to completing the adventure. But a single quest failed will cause the end of your entire adventure.

During an adventure, you have several opportunities to **automatize** the quest completition. Your adventure is won when you manage to complete a quest by *doing nothing*! Congrats, your system is fully automatic!
